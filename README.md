#  Credit Scoring Project

## 🧠 Business Understanding

The **Basel II Accord** emphasizes robust risk measurement and management, requiring financial institutions to maintain transparent and well-documented credit risk models. This regulatory framework drives the need for **interpretable models**, such as **Logistic Regression with Weight of Evidence (WoE)**, to:

- ✅ Ensure compliance  
- ✅ Facilitate audits  
- ✅ Enable clear communication of risk assessments to stakeholders  

A well-documented model supports validation and regulatory scrutiny, aligning with Basel II’s focus on standardized and reliable risk evaluation.

### ⚠️ Proxy for Default Behavior

In the absence of a direct **"default" label**, creating a **proxy variable**—such as **late payments** or **credit utilization thresholds**—is necessary to estimate credit risk. This enables modeling by approximating default behavior, but it introduces risks:

- ❗ **Misclassification** if the proxy poorly represents true default events  
- ❗ **Biased predictions** that may distort credit decisions  

These inaccuracies can lead to **increased defaults** or **lost revenue** from overly conservative lending strategies.

### ⚖️ Model Trade-offs: Interpretability vs. Performance

Choosing between **simple, interpretable models** like Logistic Regression with WoE and **complex, high-performance models** like Gradient Boosting involves trade-offs:

#### ✅ Interpretable Models (e.g., Logistic Regression with WoE)
- Easier to explain and justify  
- Compliant with regulatory expectations  
- Better for stakeholder communication  
- May **sacrifice predictive accuracy**

#### 🚀 Complex Models (e.g., Gradient Boosting)
- Higher performance  
- Capture non-linear, intricate patterns  
- Limited interpretability  
- Increased risk in regulated environments due to lack of transparency

In regulated financial contexts, **transparency and explainability** are often prioritized over marginal improvements in predictive performance.
