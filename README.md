# Credit Scoring Project

## Credit Scoring Business Understanding

The **Basel II Accord** emphasizes robust risk measurement and management, requiring financial institutions to maintain transparent and well-documented credit risk models. This regulatory framework drives the need for **interpretable models**, such as **Logistic Regression with Weight of Evidence (WoE)**, to ensure compliance, facilitate audits, and enable clear communication of risk assessments to stakeholders. A well-documented model supports validation and regulatory scrutiny, ensuring alignment with Basel II’s focus on standardized and reliable risk evaluation.

In the absence of a direct **"default" label**, creating a **proxy variable**—such as late payments or credit utilization thresholds—is necessary to estimate credit risk. This proxy enables modeling by approximating default behavior but introduces risks, including **misclassification** or **biased predictions** if the proxy poorly represents true default events. Such inaccuracies could lead to incorrect credit decisions, impacting business outcomes like increased defaults or lost revenue from overly conservative lending.

The choice between **simple, interpretable models** like Logistic Regression with WoE and **complex, high-performance models** like Gradient Boosting involves key trade-offs in a regulated financial context. Interpretable models are easier to explain, align with regulatory requirements, and facilitate compliance, but may sacrifice predictive accuracy. Complex models often yield higher performance by capturing intricate patterns but lack transparency, increasing regulatory and operational risks due to challenges in justifying decisions to auditors or stakeholders.
